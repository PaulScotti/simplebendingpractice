Welcome to beambending
======================

Okay, which concerns does this project address?

* You are taking your first course on statics and you would like to have a more interactive way of visualizing shear forces and bending moments diagrams.
* You feel you understand better when you have some examples you can modify at will.
* You want to review the basic theory, double-check that you are doing things right and test yourself with some new problems.

If any of these statements describe you, it may be worth your time to take a look at this project.
